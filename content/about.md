I am outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded. I get across to people and adjust to changes with ease. I believe that a person should work on developing their professional skills and learning new things all the time. I have more than 20 years of industry experience. i have deep understanding on Backup, Storage, Virtualization, Networks and Cloud Computing experience with the cloud providers leaders. Currently, I am looking for new career opportunities my current job position cannot provide.

When I'm not writing, I enjoy running, researching lost civilizations, analyzing constellations, and taking long drives along the Caribbean coastal highway. For up-to-date information, listen to my podcast, TechnoMythSpeaks. To hire me as a freelancer, email me at jcolonf@zenprsolutions.com.

The purpose of this blog is to document and share my thoughts and experiences with the technology I encounter on a daily basis. The views expressed on this site are my own and do not reflect those of my employer or their customers.
